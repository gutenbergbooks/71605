<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">An</span> open window filled with blue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The scent of meadows wet with dew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The talk of rooks beyond the park,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A cart wheel’s creak, a sheep-dog’s bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Greeted our waking: then we sped<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the rushy path that led<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the peat-brown river pool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, glowing, dived through ripples cool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While startled coots in skimming flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slipped among sedges out of sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or from his lonely watch the crane<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rose on slow wings; then out again<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And home to breakfast. Oh, the smell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of furze bloom and bog-asphodel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the track! but still more sweet<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fragrance of the cakes of wheat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tea, the toast, the home-baked bread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The roasted apples, all outspread<br></span>
<span class="i0">On damask white. Anon, our chairs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed back, we knelt for morning prayers,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, planning new adventures, heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">The voice devout but not the word.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No lingering then;&mdash;a hundred things,<br></span>
<span class="i0">New schemes, imagined happenings,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Called us away to wood and field&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For any hour of life might yield<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some wonder, some unthought of bliss,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some miracle we dared not miss.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gladness, hidden in the springs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of purpose at the heart of things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Showed us a world where work was play,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And common labours of the day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet service; but we knew not then<br></span>
<span class="i0">The burdens men have laid on men,&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, only those perennial tasks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which earth of all her children asks<br></span>
<span class="i0">For fruitfulness; and glad were we<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of that good fellowship to be;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sought more honour than to share<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sower’s toil, the shepherd’s care.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But most we loved the merry ring<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whetted scythes, the rhythmic swing<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of mowers, and with fork and rake<br></span>
<span class="i0">All day to follow in their wake;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And homeward in the eventide<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the piled waggon load to ride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While, half asleep amid the hay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dim fields we saw and uplands grey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br></span>

<span class="i0">The rumbling wheel along the road.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No need had we the world to roam<br></span>
<span class="i0">To find new shores, for round our home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our undiscovered lands arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">In autumn mists, in winter snows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">On summer nights in whispering trees<br></span>
<span class="i0">We heard the wash of Indian seas,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ripening waves of harvest rolled<br></span>
<span class="i0">Over our hills the realms of gold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And flood-time mapped familiar lands<br></span>
<span class="i0">With island shores and foreign strands;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tidings of unventured ways<br></span>
<span class="i0">We gathered in the darkening days<br></span>
<span class="i0">When leafless woods began to moan<br></span>
<span class="i0">And twilight opened gates unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A narrower, homelier world we knew<br></span>
<span class="i0">In winter time, and kinder grew<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sheltering bounds of landmarks old;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, gathered within farm and fold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of voices and the stir<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of labour seemed the merrier<br></span>
<span class="i0">Because so lonely and so wide<br></span>
<span class="i0">And homeless was the world outside.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then we discovered golden shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our El Dorado’s treasure stores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the piled up sheaves of grain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the barn; and while the rain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beat on the roofs we burrowed deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">In rustling caves, or from the heap<br></span>
<span class="i0">Threw down our golden citadel,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While girls unbound the sheaves that fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">For threshing, and as each new load<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the spinning rollers flowed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The hum of wheels, the engine’s drone<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden octave fell in tone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And grain was stored, and billows soft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of straw went rolling to the loft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And out on skies of cheerless grey<br></span>
<span class="i0">The winnowed chaff was blown away.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But after days of winter rains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came mornings when our window-panes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were bright with sunshine and embossed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With silver trellises of frost;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And out we rushed across the yard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down rutty cart tracks, frozen hard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And round the farm sheds and the fold<br></span>
<span class="i0">To match our blood against the cold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And every one we met was gay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And had the pleasant word to say.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What, then, were dreams of summer worth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While magic regions of the north<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay round us, and o’er fields of snow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the river’s overflow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were Arctic seas, with many a shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">And frozen inlet to explore?&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or while we tracked through forests bare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wild creatures to their hidden lair?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or, when the snow had drifted deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We helped to find the scattered sheep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or, with the shepherds and their dogs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat round a fire of brush and logs<br></span>
<span class="i0">At nightfall, when old tales were told<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of other days, and clear and cold<br></span>
<span class="i0">The starlight shone above the fold?<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not then, but when the wild South-west<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filled the dim land with its unrest<br></span>
<span class="i0">At twilight, and the woods began<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To talk of things unknown to man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the garden paths we heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strange footsteps, but no answering word<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came to our call;&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i10">’twas then the spell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of mystery about us fell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The awe that held us half-afraid<br></span>
<span class="i0">To pass beyond our gates, but made<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shelter of our homely bounds<br></span>
<span class="i0">So welcome, and familiar sounds<br></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet; ’twas then before us rose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The vision of ancestral foes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in our ears old battle calls<br></span>
<span class="i0">At night around beleaguered walls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rang; and, though all was safe and still,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Old dangers set our hearts a-thrill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in the silent courtyard made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each door and arch an ambuscade;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And passing through our sleeping camp<br></span>
<span class="i0">We heard the stabled horses champ,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And started as a halter whirred<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the chain rings when they stirred.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, with our day’s adventures o’er,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safe housed, we heard the muffled roar<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of winds without, and round the fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sought for the land of heart’s desire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or sailed across the Spanish main<br></span>
<span class="i0">In well-loved books; or lived again<br></span>
<span class="i0">In knightly days of long ago,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the horn of Ivanhoe<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ashby lists; or, on his steed<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Acre, saw King Richard lead<br></span>
<span class="i0">His pilgrim soldiers, worn and thin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That broke the ranks of Saladin:&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till, in the thickest of some fight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the captive maiden’s plight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was sorest, suddenly the spell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was broken, and a welcome bell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our own forgotten days restored<br></span>
<span class="i0">And called us to the supper board;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where, with our elders gathered round,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Good cheer and fellowship we found,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And oft a neighbour or a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tell the news or speed the jest.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all too quickly afterwards<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our bedtime came, and at their cards<br></span>
<span class="i0">And talk we left them. In the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">The firelight flickered on the wall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep shadows thronged the winding stair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And overhead, we knew not where,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A footstep fell upon the floor<br></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Over the hidden forest sweeps</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The wind, and all its haunted deeps</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Are calling, and we do not dare</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Farther beyond our walls to fare</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than o’er one field, the sheds to gain</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where, sheltered from the wind and rain,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The watchful shepherd and his dogs</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Still tarry, and a fire of logs,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A lantern’s light, a friendly bark,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Make us an outpost in the dark.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0">I miss the way! I drop the clues!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through mists of years again I lose<br></span>
<span class="i0">My childhood, and alone I sit<br></span>
<span class="i0">And watch the shadows leap and flit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Above the hearth. The world that lies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond our homely boundaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I know, and in the darkness dwell<br></span>
<span class="i0">No hidden foes, no wizard spell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But still the starry deeps are crossed<br></span>
<span class="i0">By lonelier paths than those we lost;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still the old wonder and the fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of what we know not, makes more dear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ways we know; and still, no less<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than in my childhood’s days, I bless<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shelter of their homeliness.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Amid the boundless and unknown<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each calls some guarded spot his own;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A shelter from the vast we win<br></span>
<span class="i0">In homely hearths, and make therein<br></span>
<span class="i0">The glow of light, the sound of mirth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That bind all children of the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">In brotherhood; and when the rain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beats loud upon the window-pane,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And shadows of the firelight fall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Across the floor and on the wall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all without is wild and lone<br></span>
<span class="i0">On lands and seas and worlds unknown,&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">We know that countless hearthlights burn<br></span>
<span class="i0">In darkened places, and discern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inwoven with the troubled plan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of worlds and ways unknown to man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shelter at the heart of life,<br></span>

<p class="cb">POEMS OF THE UNKNOWN WAY</p>

<p><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>&mdash;“The series of poems under the general heading, ‘The
Undiscovered Shore,’ contains some exquisite renderings of the moods and
impressions of one who goes down, literally as well as tropically, into
the great waters. They are full of melody, full of sadness&mdash;the harvest
of an eye quick to catch the beauty of external circumstance and of an
ear open to the calling of the highways of the seas and the highways of
life.... Mr. Lysaght puts an exceptional sense of rhythm at the service
of sincere thinking and fine feeling.”</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;“Mr. Lysaght has an admirable style and an almost
Swinburnian command of metre.”</p>

<p><i>LITERARY WORLD.</i>&mdash;“Here is stuff with the right ring; with an accent
such as this to guide him, the critic cannot fall into a mistake. We
have enjoyed our tour among Mr. Lysaght’s perplexities in no
half-hearted fashion.”</p>

<p class="cb"><a id="Crown_8vo_6s"></a><i>Crown</i> 8<i>vo.</i> 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="cb">HER MAJESTY’S REBELS</p>

<p><i>MORNING POST.</i>&mdash;“A most remarkable book, and no one on the look-out for
the best in contemporary fiction can afford to miss it.”</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;“Rare and charming novel.... The story is intensely
interesting, and every individual is alive and appealing.”</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;“To find fault with <i>Her Majesty’s Rebels</i> is difficult, and
to praise it worthily is not easy; few Irish books of such good parts
have come into our hands since Carleton’s days.”</p>

<p><i>STANDARD.</i>&mdash;“The story is tremendously absorbing and poignant.”</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;“A very striking story.”</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;“An able book, certainly one of the ablest of the
year.”</p>

whatever the verdict of the reader may be, he cannot fail to be
interested and attracted.”</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;“A really good and absorbing tale.”</p>

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;“There is freshness and distinction about <i>One of the
Grenvilles</i>.... Both for its characters and setting and for its author’s
pleasant wit, this is a novel to read.”</p>

<p><i>BOOKMAN.</i>&mdash;“So high above the average of novels that its readers will
want to urge on the writer a more frequent exercise of his powers.”</p>

<p class="cb">THE MARPLOT</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;“A clever, original, and vigorous work.”</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;“It is not often the path of the reviewer is brightened by so
admirable a piece of work as Mr. Lysaght’s novel, <i>The Marplot</i>.”</p>

glow of honest pleasure.... Of very high excellence.”</p>

modern fiction than <i>The Marplot</i>.”</p>
